To rectify this, Europe data will first be tidied into seperate Ireland/ Germany datasets to make it easier to identify what specific data to interpolate using the iloc replace function as it allows for specificied rows/ values to be amended, thus keeping the earlier years 0 values in tact to reflect true circumstances.  \n",
